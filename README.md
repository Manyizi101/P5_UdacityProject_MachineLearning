# P5_UdacityProject_MachineLearning

## What is it about?
In this project, we are looking at Enron dataset. 
We are building simple prediction models to flag fraudsters (also called person of interest or POI) in the dataset.

This is a machine learning project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. 
Here are the links, in case you are interested:
* Intro to Machine Learning course: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120
* Data Analyst Nanodegree program: https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002

## What can you find in this repo?
1. poi_id.py: Python script for machine learning classifiers
2. Enron_EDA.ipynb: Initial exploratory data analysis of Enron dataset
3. Enron_Submission_Free_Response_Questions.pdf: Answers to Udacity's free-response questions
4. Sources.txt: Websites, blogs, and forums that I referred to while doing this project
